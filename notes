Notes
---

Program can be run with the argument "p_test" to run it in performance testing mode.
This test reads in a file of random words and uses a selection at random to test each of the three methods (String match, Regex Match and Index)
2 million times and records the duration of each search in milliseconds. It then saves the list of durations to three separate files for
further analysis and prints out the min, max and mean for each of the three tests. Note that the index search method indexes the text files into
ArrayLists every time the method is called. I have added a Static Index search method that reads all three files into ArrayLists stored in memory prior to
running any searches to the performance test to see if that is faster.

I found that the Regex method was the slowest, while the String and Index methods appeared to be about the same; likely because they rely on the same
String.equals() methods for comparison. Indexing the files once and then running searches on them in memory is significantly faster.
